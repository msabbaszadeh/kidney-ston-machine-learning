# 🧠 **Kidney Stone Prediction using Machine Learning**

## 📘 **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates a **machine learning pipeline** for predicting **kidney stone disease** based on clinical and chemical parameters.
It utilizes **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Seaborn**, and **TensorFlow**, offering **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **visualization**, and **model comparison** using **LazyPredict** to identify the most accurate classifier.

---

## ⚙️ **Dataset Description**

The dataset contains **90 samples** with the following features:

* **gravity**
* **ph**
* **osmo**
* **cond**
* **urea**
* **calc**
* **target** → *(0 = No Stone, 1 = Stone)*

✅ **No missing or duplicate values** detected.
✅ **Data is clean and ready for modeling.**

---

## 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* **Pair plots** and **heatmaps** were used to understand correlations.
* **Strong correlations** observed:

  * `gravity` ↔ `osmo` (**r = 0.85**)
  * `urea` ↔ `osmo` (**r = 0.89**)
  * `calc` ↔ `target` (**r = 0.46**)

These correlations suggest that **urine concentration and calcium levels** are key indicators for **kidney stone formation**.
